      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>This is the internet’s largest collaborative artwork. A single canvas created by people from all over the world, 
        where each participant makes one tiny artistic decision and leaves one permanent mark.</p>

      <p>What happens when a million strangers each make one tiny artistic decision? No one knows — and that uncertainty is the point. 
        Once a mark is placed,  it cannot be changed, removed, or corrected. There are no edits, no revisions, and no second chances. 
      </p>

      <p> When the final mark is placed, the artwork is complete forever. It will never change again. This artwork exists only because 
        people choose to participate — each mark equal, each decision final, each contribution part of something larger than itself.

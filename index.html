      <!-- What is this -->

     <section id="about" class="about container">
      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>This is the internet’s largest collaborative artwork. A single canvas created by people from all over the world, 
        where each participant makes one tiny artistic decision and leaves one permanent mark.</p>

      <p>What happens when a million strangers each make one tiny artistic decision? No one knows — and that uncertainty is the point. 
        Once a mark is placed,  it cannot be changed, removed, or corrected. There are no edits, no revisions, and no second chances. 
      </p>

      <p> When the final mark is placed, the artwork is complete forever. It will never change again. This artwork exists only because 
        people choose to participate — each mark equal, each decision final, each contribution part of something larger than itself.
      </p>
     </section>

     <!-- How it works? -->

     <section is="how" class="how container">
      <h2>How it works?</h2>
      <p>The artwork is made up of one million individual marks, placed by one million people. Each participant is invited to place 
        one single mark on the canvas — a color, a position, a small decision that becomes part of the whole.</p>

      <p>Once a mark is placed, it is permanent. It cannot be moved, edited, or removed. There are no revisions and no second attempts.
         Every contribution carries the same weight, whether it is the first mark or the last.
      </p>

      <p>The artwork evolves slowly as people participate. There is no predetermined image and no final plan. The outcome emerges only 
        through collective action. When the millionth mark is placed, the artwork is complete — and it will never change again.
